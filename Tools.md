# Architecture & Orchestration

* **Keep your layers, add a “Guardrails & Budget” sublayer** inside the Orchestration layer: input/output validators, per-tool rate limits, and a *max tool-calls per turn* to prevent loops. Enforce with JSON Schema + strict structured outputs where possible. ([OpenAI Platform][1], [Microsoft Learn][2])
* **Adopt OpenAI’s built-in tools as first-class citizens** (via the Responses API): web search, file search, and MCP tools; keep your adapters for 3P search as fallback. This simplifies orchestration and lets the model decide when to search. ([OpenAI][3], [OpenAI Platform][4])
* **Consider MCP for tool hosting** instead of hard-wiring every function: expose your tools via an MCP server and register them as hosted MCP tools so the model can call them directly. Keeps the registry simple and tool discovery standardized. ([OpenAI Platform][5], [OpenAI GitHub][6])

# Function/Tool Calling

* **Use Structured Outputs to validate tool args** (and your final response structs) rather than relying on free-form JSON. Models still hallucinate/over-specify args—validate before execution. ([OpenAI Platform][1], [Microsoft Learn][7])
* **Support `tool_choice` modes** (auto/none/required) per intent. For “must-search” flows, force a tool call; otherwise let the model decide. (Pattern supported in Responses + tools.) ([OpenAI Platform][4])
* **Return compact tool payloads** (limit fields, truncate bodies, keep citations) to control token bloat in follow-up turns.

# Web Search Pipeline

* **Add an internal search pipeline** (query rewrite → provider selection → fetch → content extraction → dedupe → summarize w/ citations).

  * Default to **OpenAI Web Search** for simplicity & grounding; switch to **Tavily** when you need raw content extraction or different ranking knobs; Serper stays as tertiary. ([OpenAI Platform][8])
  * **Tavily cost controls:** explicitly set `search_depth` (advanced costs 2 credits) and only enable `include_raw_content` when you truly need full text. Also set `max_results`. ([docs.tavily.com][9], [Tavily Community][10], [help.tavily.com][11])
  * Plumb **web-search options** like locale/user location when relevant (e.g., nearby queries). ([GitHub][12])

# Realtime Voice Specifics

* **Use Realtime API function-calling events** so tool calls are triggered mid-conversation without blocking audio; support barge-in and cancellation (kill outstanding tool work on interrupt). ([OpenAI Platform][13])
* **Two-lane response strategy:** stream speech immediately with a short “setting it up…” filler, then splice in results when the tool returns (or hand off to a second TTS segment).

# Memory & Retrieval (Supabase pgvector)

* **Indexing choice:** start with **HNSW** for high-throughput approximate NN; fall back to IVFFlat if you prefer easier rebuilds/accuracy tradeoffs. Measure on your data. ([Supabase][14], [GitHub][15], [DEV Community][16])
* **Write policy:** gate “what gets remembered” (entities, preferences, tasks) and keep an episodic short-term summary separate from long-term vector memory; include recency/metadata filters in queries.
* **Latency guard:** cap retrieval time (e.g., 150–250 ms). If exceeded, answer without RAG and optionally follow up.

# Reliability, Observability, & Testing

* **Adopt Agents SDK for tracing + sessions** in dev/prod to see each tool/run step; it also gives you built-in guardrails and handoffs if you later split agents. ([npm][17], [GitHub][18])
* **Circuit breakers + failover** in your Provider Adapters (OpenAI Web → Tavily basic → Serper). Log p95 latency, success rate, and cost per successful answer.
* **Golden-set evals**: measure tool-call precision/recall, TTFT, total latency, cost/turn, and user-rated helpfulness.

# Security & Compliance

* **Per-tool allowlists & auth scopes** (no arbitrary URLs/APIs).
* **PII handling** in memory (hash emails/phones; TTL for sensitive notes).
* **Privacy in sharing**: if you ever expose result links, ensure they’re not inadvertently indexable (recent incident shows why to be explicit). ([Tom's Guide][19], [TechRadar][20])

# Config Model

* Extend `AgentConfig` with:

  * `webProviderOrder`, `perToolBudget`, `maxToolCallsPerTurn`, `retryPolicy`, `userLocale`, `locationHints`, and `cacheTTL`.
  * Add a **“search profile”** (news vs. evergreen) to tune depth/results per query type.
  * Optional **MCP servers list** (label + URL + auth) so you can hot-plug capabilities. ([OpenAI Platform][5])

# Migration Path (tuned)

* **Phase 1:** Keep your DIY registry but switch your LLM calls to **Responses API with tools** (gives you built-ins + consistent streaming & state). ([OpenAI][21], [OpenAI Cookbook][22])
* **Phase 2:** Move web search to **OpenAI Web** as default; keep Tavily/Serper adapters for fallback and specialty fetches. ([OpenAI Platform][8])
* **Phase 3:** Introduce **MCP-hosted tools** for your custom capabilities (calendar, CRM, internal KB) to reduce bespoke glue. ([OpenAI Platform][5])
* **Phase 4:** Layer in **Agents SDK** only where you need sessions, handoffs, and guardrails; keep your orchestrator for fine-grained control. ([OpenAI Platform][23])

# Small Code-Level Tweaks

* **Tool interface:** add `timeoutMs`, `budgetCents`, `retry` and `safeParams` (server-side coercion/validation).
* **Registry:** expose `getAvailableTools(context)` so you can dynamically enable/disable based on auth, device, or network.
* **Search provider interface:** standardize a *lean* `SearchResult` (title, url, snippet, published\_at, source\_rank, raw\_excerpt?) plus `citations` array.

If you want, I can sketch a minimal Next + Realtime + Responses wiring that shows: (1) streaming voice, (2) mid-turn web-search tool call, (3) MCP-hosted custom tool, and (4) structured outputs for arguments/results.
